            <p>Theodore John Kaczynski (May 22,1942 â€“ June 10, 2023), also known as the Unabomber 
                (University and Airline Bomber), was an American mathematician and domestic terrorist.
                He was a mathematics prodigy, but abandoned his academic career in 1969 to pursue a primitive lifestyle.
                Between 1978 and 1995, Kaczynski murdered three individuals and injured 23 others in a nationwide mail
                bombing campaign against people he believed to be advancing modern technology and the destruction of the natural environment.
                He authored Industrial Society and Its Future, a 35,000-word manifesto and social critique opposing industrialization, rejecting leftism, and advocating for a
                nature-centered form of anarchism.
